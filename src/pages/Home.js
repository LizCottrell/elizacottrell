          This site is intended to show my work and career transition from
          archaeology to technology. I accomplished my career change through
          meetups, online MOOCs, workshops, networking, and simply putting
          myself out there. My passion-projects are web accessibility and
          motivating people of all backgrounds looking to break into tech.
